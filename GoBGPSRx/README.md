# GoBGPSRx 

GoBGPSRx extends GoBGPsec and adds ASPA and AS-Cones validation. 

## GoBGPsec

GoBGPsec uses NIST SRxCrypto library to facilitate crypto calculations
which is able to sign and verify X.509 objects for BGPSec path validation. 
This software is based on [Gobgp](https://github.com/osrg/gobgp) BGP implementation and added codes for 
implementing BGPSec protocol ([RFC 8205](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8205)).

This work is part of the larger [NIST Robust Inter Domain Routing Project](https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/robust-inter-domain-routing) that addresses a wide range of security and resilience issues in the Internet’s routing infrastructure. The software in this repository is a component of a larger [suite of software tools](https://www.nist.gov/services-resources/software/bgp-secure-routing-extension-bgp-srx-software-suite) developed within the project.


## Project Status

Active development




## Getting Started

You need a working Go Environment 

* go version > 1.13 
* protoc version == 3.7.1


### Prerequisites
GoBGPSRx requires a running SRx-Server.
GoBGPsec requires to use this crypto library for signing and validation 
when the BGPSec operation starts.
* Need to install SRxCryptoAPI library and SRx-Server first
* Need SRxCryptoAPI library >= v3.0


Download NIST SRx software from the link below. 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/usnistgov/NIST-BGP-SRx.git
```

And then build with buildBGP-SRx.sh script.
It will install automatically all the packages.
```bash
./buildBGP-SRx.sh
```

For more information such as key generation for signing and etc,
please refer to [NIST SRxCryptoAPI](https://github.com/usnistgov/NIST-BGP-SRx/tree/master/srx-crypto-api) page.


### Build 
To import NIST SRxCryptoAPI library, need to specify the library location with a build or
install command. Otherwise LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable might be used.



Avoiding the LD_LIBRARY_PATH for Shared Libs in Go (cgo) Applications   
```
export CGO_LDFLAGS="-L/path/to/lib64/srx -Wl,-rpath -Wl,/path/to/lib64/srx"

```


### Install
To Install on Localhost: Replace /root/... path in bgpsec.go with paths on localhosts.

Install binaries into $GOPATH/bin. Simply use 'install' instead of 'build' in commands
```
go install ./...
```

### BGPSec and SRx-Server Configuration
 [GoBGPsec Configuration](docs/sources/bgpsec.md)
</br></br>

### Quick Start

```bash
# gobgpd -p -f /etc/gobgpd.conf --log-level=debug
````
## With Docker
* Replace Docker File of NIST-BGP-SRx repository with Dockerfile in GoBGPSRx
* Copy GoBGPSRx into NIST-BGP-SRx directory
