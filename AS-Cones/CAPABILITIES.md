# NIST BGP-SRx Software Suite #

## Introduction ##
>
>The NIST (S)ecure (R)outing E(x)tension (SRx) provides a set of tools for BGP-Security. The Software Suite contains five major components:
>
>1. SRx-Crypto-API
>2. SRx-Server and Proxy
>3. BGPsec-IO Traffic Generator and BGPsec validation tester
>4. QuaggaSRx
>5. Experimentation Framework
>
>The details of the components 1 - 4 can be found int the NIST Technical Note [TN-2060](https://www.nist.gov/publications/bgp-secure-routing-extension-bgp-srx-reference-implementation-and-test-tools-emerging). This document functions as a quick overview of the capabilities and features of the NIST BGP-SRx Software Suite.

### Additional Implementations ###

In addition to the above mentioned components two more implementations were created that make usage of the
SRx-Crypto-API as well as the SRx-Server. These two components are:

1. **ExaBGPsec** - Navigate to [code at GitHub](https://github.com/usnistgov/exabgpsrx)
2. **GoBGPsec** - Navigate to [code at GitHub](https://github.com/usnistgov/gobgpsrx)

More detailed information on each implementation can be found in each respective GitHub repository.

>   * CLI to control emulator in real time.
>* Allow configuration of BGPsec validation algorithm using API plugin mechanism.
>   * Use alternative BGPsec cryptographic implementations.
>* BGP/BGPsec Traffic generator
>   * Allow to script BGP-4 and BGPsec UPDATES.
>   * Provide debug printer to analyze BGP/BGPsec traffic on sender and receiver side.
>   * Provide capability of deterministic ECDSA signatures using specified k-value.
>   * Provide capability to use pre-scripted signature value to test validation algorithm.
>   * Allow traffic generator to function as traffic monitor.
> * Allow to bind BGP UPDATE player to specific NIC to allow multiple traffic generators to operate on the same system

## Module Description ##
>
>### SRx Crypto API ###
>
>The SRx Crypto API (SCA) is used to provide a mechanism to exchange BGPsec cryptographic implementations without the need to recompile the software. Once installed, it provides a configuration file that is used to select the appropriate BGPsec algorithm implementation. The implementation MUST follow the SCA's API specification outlined in the header file srxcryptoapi.h.
>
>Furthermore, SCA provides a simplified key storage that allows to load keys on the hard drive for easy access.
>
>### SRx-Server ###
>
>The SRx-Server (SRxSnP) provides the validation engine for BGPsec Path Validation, BGP Route Origin Validation, and introduced in version 6 of the software also ASPA path validation. The SRx-Server communicates with RPKI validation caches using the cache to router protocol RFC 8210 and 8610. For communication with routers the SRx-Server implementation provides a proxy API that hides the communication complexities to the client. In case the router does not want to use the proxy, the SRx-Server provides a TCP based protocol to communicate validation requests and validations.
>
>#### Utilities ####
>
>> This package provides a validation server test harness that emulates a Resource PKI (RPKI) validation cache that is providing Route Attestation Objects (ROA), BGPsec keys, and with NIST BGP-SRx version 6 also ASPA Objects to be send to the routers. This emulator can be controlled using scripts.

### BGPsec-IO ###

>The BGPsec-IO (BIO) is a traffic generator that allows to generate regular BGP-4 UPDATES as well as scripted multi-hop end to end signed BGPsec UPDATE traffic. It can pre-generate traffic to be re-played at a later time as well as generate traffic while receiving ASCII text-based UPDATE (prefix-as-path list) via standard in and send it to a connected BGP/BGPsec router instance.
>
>### Quagga-SRx ###
>
> The Quagga-SRx (QSRx) implementation is based on Quagga 0.99. It implements the capability to process BGP Origin Validation, BGP Path Validation, as well as with version 6.0 ASPA path validation.
>
>#### Version 5 ####
>
>>This implementation modified the decision process of the BGP routing engine. It allows to either perform BGP Origin Validation (BGP-OV) or both BGP-OV combined with BGPsec Path Validation (BGP-PV). Therefore, the policies are tailored to a final validation outcome.
>
>#### Version 6 ####
>>
>> Version 6 does not touch the decision process anymore. Also, the validation results are no longer combined to calculate a cumulative result. Policies can be crafted around each validation separately.
>
>### Experiments ###
>
>The experiments folder contains experimentation for each validation mode and one combining all tree modes. Each experiment can be run in a "Sandbox" environment. A new feature is the addition of Framework Test Generators (TFG). The latest one it the TFG for ASPA.

>### ExaBGPsec ###
>ExaBGPsec uses NIST SRxCrypto library to facilitate cryptographic calculations which is able to deal with X.509 objects for BGPSec path validation. This software is based on Exabgp BGP implementation and added codes for implementing BGPSec protocol (RFC 8205).
>
>### GoBGPsec ###
>
>GoBGPsec uses NIST SRxCrypto library to facilitate crypto calculations which is able to sign and verify X.509 objects for BGPSec path validation. This software is based on Gobgp BGP implementation and added codes for implementing BGPSec protocol (RFC 8205).
