    the IANA assigned values. 
    For backwards compatibility with code written during the time where IANA did

    sending.
  * Added code to generate BGP4 updates if bgpsec is not negotiated for the

  * Added missing capability exchange for extended BGP messages (>4096) bytes
    as specified in draft-ietf-idr-extended-messages
  * Added capability to specify K for generating signatures using ECDSA
  * Added capability to specify if the BGP Path Attribute should use a one byte
    length field or if the length field should be 2 byte (3xtended length). 
    For this the parameter only_extended_length (default: true) is added to the
    configuration file. 
  * Fixed BUG in printing received bgpsec path attributes where the path 
    attributes length field is only one byte of size.
