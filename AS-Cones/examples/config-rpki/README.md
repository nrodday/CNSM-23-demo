# The RPKI Cache Test Harness does not really have any configuration.
# The port is handed over during the start of the cache and once started
# it provides a CLI that allows to specify RPKI objects.
#
# Here the RPKI Cache Test Harness does provide a rather extensive help
# screen. All commands can be scritped and loaded.
#
# This folder contains a simple test script that shows how a "configuration"
# script can look like.
