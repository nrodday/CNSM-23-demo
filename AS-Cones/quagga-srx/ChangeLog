      existence of needed tools depending on configured settings.
    * Fixed bug in .texi doc files that prevented a proper rpm generation.

    * Updated spec file.
    * Added include "config.h" to bgpd/bgpd.h

  0.4.2.7 - May - July 2020
    * Removed doc folder from build scripts due to text compile errors which require
      --disable-doc and prevent rpms from being created. Might be added at a later 
      point in time again. Search for ^^ -*-DOC-*- ^^ in 
      configure.ac, Makefile.am, and redhat/quagga.spec.in

    * Update implementation to comply with latest BGPsec Protocol specification
    * Modified the values of CAPABILITY_CODE_BGPSEC and BGP_ATTR_BGPSEC to
      the IANA assigned values.
      For backwards compatibility with code written during the time where IANA 
      did not have the values assigned yet, these values still can be modified 
      during compile time to other values using -DCAPABILITY_CODE_BGPSEC=<num>
      and -DBGP_ATTR_BGPSEC=<num>
      - for backwards compatibility the previously used values were 
        [CAPABILITY_CODE_BGPSEC=72] and [CAPABILITY_CODE_BGPSEC=30]
